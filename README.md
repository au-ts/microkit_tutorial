# A tutorial for the seL4 Microkit

The [seL4 Microkit](https://github.com/seL4/Microkit) is a
minimal operating system framework made for developing systems using the seL4
microkernel.

The tutorial is available [here](https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/microkit/tutorial/welcome.html).

This repository contains the infrastructure and material for the tutorial. If
you are developing the tutorial itself, the rest of the README is for you.

## Tutorial website

The tutorial is delivered using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/),
a fairly accessible way for making small online guides, books and tutorials
using Markdown.

### Working on the tutorial website

#### Install mdBook

Install the mdBook tool and `mdbook-variables` preprocessor using
[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

```sh
cargo install --locked mdbook-variables mdbook-tabs mdbook
```

#### Developing and making changes to the website

The source for the website is under `website/src/`.

To start a local webserver to serve the website, run the following:

```sh
cd website
./develop.sh
```

#### Building the website for deployment

To build the website run:
```sh
cd website
./build.sh
```

The built website will be in `website/build/`.
